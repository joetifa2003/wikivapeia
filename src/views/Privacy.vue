            <p>
              We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety
              of your personal information. Your personal information is
              contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a

              When you place orders or access your personal information, we
              offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information
              you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology

            <p><strong>Do we use "cookies"?</strong></p>
            <p>
              Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
              transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser
              (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's
              systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
              information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
              process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to
              help us understand your preferences based on previous or current
              site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
              services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data
              about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer
              better site experiences and tools in the future.
            </p>

              We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in
              better understanding our site visitors. These service providers
              are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf
              except to help us conduct and improve our business.

              You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie

              our services will not function properly. However, you can still
